Question: ILO’s Decent Work Standards on Working Hours apply for India?
```python
{
    "Max 40–48 hours per week": "Partially. While the Factories Act specifies a 48-hour work week for factories, this is not universally applied across all sectors in India. Many sectors, particularly in the informal economy, exceed this limit.",
    "Overtime should be limited": "Partially. The Factories Act does address overtime, but enforcement and compliance vary. Limits exist, but are not always adhered to, especially in unorganized sectors.",
    "Work-life balance encouraged": "Limited. While there is growing awareness and some policies promoting work-life balance, it is not a widespread or consistently enforced standard across all industries and types of employment in India.",
    "Proper rest periods required": "Partially. Legal provisions exist for rest periods, particularly within the Factories Act and Shops and Establishments Acts. However, implementation and adherence vary significantly across sectors and are often lacking in the informal economy."
