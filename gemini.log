Question: ILO’s Decent Work Standards on Working Hours apply for India?
```python
{
"Max 40–48 hours per week": "Partially. While the Factories Act prescribes a 48-hour work week for factories, this doesn't cover the entire workforce. Many sectors are unregulated or have different standards.",
"Overtime should be limited": "Partially. The Factories Act regulates overtime and provides for overtime pay, but enforcement and coverage are inconsistent across sectors.",
"Work-life balance encouraged": "Limited. While there is increasing awareness, legal mandates and widespread implementation to actively promote work-life balance are lacking.",
"Proper rest periods required": "Partially. The Factories Act mandates rest periods, but compliance and applicability vary significantly across different types of employment."
